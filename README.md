# Voight-Kampff Machine (VKM)

Voight-Kampff Machine is an approach to automatically select a rejection threshold for custom gestures. In high activity (HA) continuous data stream the start and end points of gestures are unknown, and standard approaches to segmentation based on low-activity regions result in high false positive rates. VKM, on the other hand, selects tight rejection threshold so as to minimize the number of false positives and false negatives. This means that with only a few training samples per class, the user can get an accurate custom gesture recognizer even when contiuous data is high activity.

This repository contains a [reference Python VKM implementation](https://github.com/ISUE/VKM) with support for full-body Kinect gestures.

## Datasets   

A high activity dataset of four device types (Kinect, Mouse, Vive Position, Vive Quaternion) is included with the publication. The dataset will be automatically downloaded and uncompressed the first time you run the `main.py` file. You can also manually download the dataset [here](https://www.eecs.ucf.edu/isuelab/research/vkm/VKM_datasets_kinect_mouse_vive.zip).

## Running the code

Working on Python 3.9.6 âœ…   
Windows:
```cmd
$ git clone https://github.com/ISUE/VKM
$ cd VKM\python
$ python -m venv myenv
$ myenv\Scripts\activate
$ pip install numpy
$ python main.py
```
Linux, Mac (conda is the easiest way to support M1)
```zsh
$ git clone https://github.com/ISUE/VKM
$ cd VKM/python
$ conda create -n myenv python=3.9.6 numpy
$ conda activate myenv
$ python main.py
```
## More Details

For the [publication](https://www.eecs.ucf.edu/isuelab/publications/pubs/Taranta2022.pdf), we evaluated VKM as part of a continuous data processing pipeline, to which we refer to as The Dollar General (TDG) [4]. TDG consists of device-agnostic gesture recognition techniques, and its main components are: Machete [2], which proposes regions that might be gestures; Jackknife [1], which classifies the proposed regions; VKM [this work], which rejects input that does not cross the similarity threshold.
